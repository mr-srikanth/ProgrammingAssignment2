## This program allows users to compute mean of large vectors.
## It uses lexical scoping in R to allow computation of mean over large vectors
## Cached computing is critical for handling large data sets, especiaaly when
## the data set doesnt fit into memory. 
## This method can also be used for running computation of mean. This method 
## will be useful for computing mean on large vectors that do not cahnge often.
